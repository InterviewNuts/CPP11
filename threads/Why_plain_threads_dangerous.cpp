/*
When we start a thread, there are two options. 
1) Either we will wait for the thread to finish or 
2) we will not wait for it. 

A mechanism for waiting is a .join() member function. 
The .detach() member function is the other option: not waiting for the thread to finish.

Therefore, we must choose between these two options. If we donâ€™t detach or join the thread, 
the program will crash! 
Just comment a .join() call , compile and run the program. 
You should get an error message:
